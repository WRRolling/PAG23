DNA for Genotyping was isolated from ~20 mg of lyophilize leaf tissue with a Machery-Nagel (https://www.mn-net.com/) NucleoSpin 96-well kit for DNA from plants using manufacturer’s protocol, specifically using lysis buffer PL1. Whole genome resequencing was completed at the University of California, Davis Genome Center in Davis with CA.Paired-end libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000. Genotyping-by-sequencing (Elshire et al 2011) was completed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Biotechnology Center (WI). DNA concentration was quantified with a Quant-iT™ PicoGren® dsDNA kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and 150ng of DNA was digested with ApeKI, (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and barcode adapters were added with T4 ligase (New EnglaPrepnd Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and amplified for pooled sequencing of 96 samples. Prepared libraries were analyzed for quality and quantity on Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), respectively. Libraries were sequenced targeting 3 million reads per sample. Variant Calling was completed in the TASSEL-GBS pipeline (v5.2.39) (Glaubitz et al. 2014) assembling reads to the carrot reference genome (Iorizzo et al. 2016). 

Carotenoid accumulation was measured using high performance liquid chromatography as previously described by Ellison et al (2018). Samples were collected within four-weeks of harvest, a slice of root tissue was collected from the mid-root of the carrot. The tissue was dried on a lyopholizer for ~5 days and homogenized. Then ~0.1 g of tissue was soaked in 2.0 ml of petroleum for 16 hours at 4 °C. HPLC was completed by combining 700 µl of methanol and 300 µl of the root extract eluted through a Rainin (Mettler-Toledo LLC, Columbus, OH) Microsorb-MV 5 µm column and detected on a Shimadzu (Columbia, Maryland) SPD-M20A photodiode array detector. Two technical replicates were completed for each biological sample  with carotenoids were quantified at an absorption of 450 nm. The phenotype used in genome-wide association analyses was the rati of alpha & beta carotenoid relative to lutein.
